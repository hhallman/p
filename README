NAME
       p - project manager


SYNOPSIS
       p [create] project-name
       p menu

AVAILABILITY
       bash


DESCRIPTION
       Utility for your shell that lets you easily step to project directories while
       loading a project-specific profile into your shell.

       You can use a user-wide profile ('pfile') and/or project specific profiles.

OPTIONS
       âˆ’s step to the project directory in a subshell.


EXAMPLES
       p foo	 	open project foo
       p -s foo 	open project foo in subshell
       p create bar create and open project bar in current directory
       p create      create project at current directory named as current folder

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
       p global <projectname>      sources the projects p-file in the current shell with the first parameter as "global".
              Used to load a project's features to the global shell environment. E.g. add 'p global myproject' to your init script.
       p runin <projectname> <cmd> runs cmd in projectname's folder. The pfile is not used!
       p runall <cmd>              runs cmd in all projects folder's. The pfile is not used!

NOTES
       Automatic installation:
              bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhallman/p/master/p-projectmanager-install.sh)

       Manual installation:
       Put something like this in your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc:
	      . /path/to/p.sh

       create some projects and enjoy!

       Optionally:
	Set $_P_CMD to change the command name (default p).
	(These settings should go in .bashrc/.zshrc  before  the  lines  added
       above.)
	Install  the provided man page p.1 somewhere like /usr/local/man/man1.


       Tab Completion:

       p supports tab completion. After typing the p command, press TAB  to
       complete project names that match (optionally) written project names.

       Project menu:
       The project menu might be handy. To get a project-greeting in new shells, type
       $ p menu. 
       It may be handy to get the project-menu in new shells:
       $ echo 'p menu' >> ~/.bash_profile

PFILES
       When opening a project, p will source global and local 'pfiles',
       ~/.pfile.sh and ./.pfile.sh with arguments "enter" "project-name" "project-directory".
       If the project is loaded in subshell, the pfiles will be sourced with "leave" 
       instead of "enter" when the shell exits.
       Example of global pfile:
       		[ "$1"  == "enter" ] && [ -d .git ] && echo "git status" && git status;
			[ "$1"  == "enter" ] && [ -d .svn ] && echo "svn status" && svn status;	


ENVIRONMENT
       A function _p() is defined.

       The contents of the variable $_P_CMD is aliased to _p. If not set,
       $_P_CMD defaults to p.


       To set the subshell behavior as default, set variable _p_subshell=true


FILES
       Data is stored in $HOME/.p. This  can  be  overridden  by  setting  the
       $_P_DATA environment variable.

       A man page (p.1) is provided.
